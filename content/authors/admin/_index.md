  #   summary: |
  #     Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hello! I’m Neha Kulkarni, a Master’s student in Computer Science at Rochester Institute of Technology, passionate about Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Data Science. In my free time, you’ll mostly find me listening to Hozier’s latest album, reading my book somewhere on campus or simply going for a run outdoors.

Currently, I’m working on LiDAR-based parking spot detection, leveraging 3D point cloud data to enhance autonomous vehicle technologies.
